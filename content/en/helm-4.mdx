**Helm 4** is not just an incremental update; it's a significant overhaul that aligns the tool with modern K8s best practices, focusing on stability, security, and efficiency.

### 1. Server-Side Apply (SSA)

The main architectural change. Helm 4 abandons the complex client-side *three-way merge* logic in favor of Kubernetes native **Server-Side Apply (SSA)**.

SSA ensures that Helm only declares its **intent** for the fields defined in the *Chart*, delegating the final state resolution to K8s.

### 2. Stability with kstatus

Operations with `--wait` in Helm are now more reliable thanks to the **kstatus** library integration.

* **What it does:** `kstatus` provides a granular, rule-based assessment of what constitutes a "ready" or "healthy" K8s resource.

* **Technical Advantage:** It goes beyond simple replica counting in a `Deployment`. It considers complex conditions of more sophisticated resources (e.g., completed *Jobs*, stable *StatefulSets*). Your CI/CD will have safer deployments, ensuring the next step only starts when the application is **effectively** in service.


---

### 3. Supply Chain Security

**Open Container Initiative (OCI)** support has been improved with an explicit focus on integrity. This ensures that the downloaded and applied *Chart* is **bit-for-bit** identical to the original signed artifact, preventing tampering attacks in the supply chain.

It's now possible to reference OCI *Charts* by **digest (SHA256)**, not just by version tag.

* ```bash
    helm install app oci://registry.com/charts/app@sha256:digest-hash-a42...
    ```


---

### 4. Modularity and Organization with Multi-Document Values

For enterprise or complex *Charts*, maintaining a single monolithic `values.yaml` was challenging. Now you can structure your environment configurations (Dev, Staging, Prod) or functional sections (DB, Caching, Monitoring) in a cleaner and more modular way.

Helm 4 accepts multiple YAML documents in the main values file or in files passed via the `--values` flag.

---

### 5. Refactored Plugins and Post-Renderers

Helm's extension capabilities gained a more secure and formalized framework.

* **Post-Renderers:** Tools that modify K8s manifests after the templating phase (e.g., kustomize, yq) are now primarily implemented as plugins.

* **Future:** The plugin system is being revised with a vision for optional **WebAssembly (Wasm)** adoption, which will provide a sandboxed execution environment for extensions, increasing security.

### 6. CLI Flags (Breaking Changes)

To align command semantics, some command-line flags have been renamed.
