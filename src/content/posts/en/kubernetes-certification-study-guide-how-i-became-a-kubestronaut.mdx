Throughout my professional journey with Kubernetes, I faced (and conquered!) the challenge of obtaining the main certifications offered by CNCF. It was months of focused study, intense practice, and continuous learning – which resulted in the following achievements:

* CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) – 99/100
* CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) – 88/100
* CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist) – 88/100
* KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate) – 90/100
* KCSA (Kubernetes and Cloud Security Associate) – 81/100

## How I Prepared

From the beginning, I decided to create my own study materials. My goal was simple: focus on what really matters, with practice and objectivity.

I studied based on official documentation, reference courses, practice exams, and many hands-on exercises. But I felt that organization and content direction made all the difference – so I structured everything in the clearest and most direct way possible.

Now I'm sharing this material with the community, so that more people can benefit from this path.

## Complete Documentation

I created structured documentation with the most relevant topics for each certification:

## Repository with Commands, Examples, and Practice

In addition to the documentation, I also organized a GitHub repository with:

* Frequently used commands in the exams
* Real examples applied to clusters
* Troubleshooting and debugging tips
* Study structure by certification

> This material does not replace the official Kubernetes documentation, but serves as a practical guide focused on the most recurring topics – both in exams and in real life as a professional who works with Kubernetes daily.
